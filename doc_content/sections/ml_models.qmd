# Machine Learning Models

Our time series web app utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast time series data. Currently, our app employs XGBoost, a powerful and efficient algorithm for handling complex time series data. 

## XGBoost Model Overview

Our XGBoost model is a powerful and efficient algorithm that is well-suited for handling complex time series data. The model is trained on a combination of technical indicators and moving averages, including:

☞ Simple Moving Averages (SMA): 5, 10, 15, 30

☞ Exponential Moving Average (EMA): 9

☞ Relative Strength Index (RSI): 14

☞ Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): 12, 26

These features are used to capture trends, momentum, and volatility in the time series data. The XGBoost model is trained to predict future values based on these features.
