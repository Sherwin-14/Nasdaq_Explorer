# Deep Learning Models

Our stock prediction tool has a section for deep learning techniques to analyze and forecast time series data. Currently, we only support LSTM but we are planning to add more algorithms in the upcoming versions. 

## LSTM Model Overview

Our LSTM model is powerful and  well-suited for handling complex time series data. The model is trained on a combination of technical indicators and moving averages, including:
